## How does it look like?

```kotlin

## Features

### Static typing by default

- Static typing is just much better for IDE support

- Creates much better optimization opportunities by the compiler

- Static typing works better with value semantics (reduce boxing)

- Static typing makes the compiler/VM more complex and slow?

    - Devs tend to add gradual typing to their dynamic-typed languages anyway...

    - We should do this at the beginning instead of retrofitting it in the middle of language development

### Value semantics by default

- Reduce excessive boxing which is typical in managed languages

    - Reduce alloc/dealloc costs

    - Better cache locality (ex. arrays and hashmaps can now store values contiguously)

    - Less pressure on the refcount system

- Enables fast interop with C / C++ structs

- In / out references for value objects

    - Out reference (out): write-only (out parameters in C#)

    - Inout reference (inout): the combination of the two (ref parameter in C#)

    - Note that these references cannot be converted to uniq / ref / weak in any way!

    - There is no 'in' reference, just pass by value instead!

        - The value will be copied only if it overwritten inside the function, or small enough (<= 16 bytes)

- Capturing by closure always copies the value instead of referencing it

    - Removes confusion ("the dreaded for-loop dillema")

    - Simpler language design (no need for a complex reference system)

    - If you really want to share a value with a closure, box the value and take a strong / weak reference instead!

### No garbage collection, memory management with unique / strong / weak references

- Three kinds of "smart pointers" for boxed objects, for convenience and safety:

    - Unique reference (uniq): Owns the object, can be new / deleted

    - Strong reference (ref): References the object, asserts when a dangling reference is produced

        - Basically a borrow checker done at runtime!

        - Uses ref-counting under the hood

        - Compiler can optimize out some inc-ref / dec-refs with static analysis

    - Weak reference (weak): References the object, asserts when a dangling reference is used

        - Provides much faster weak pointers than C++!

        - Uses random generational uids under the hood

        - The only reference type that can be 'null'

- Auto-dereference by default (no -> as in C++)

- Auto-conversion rules (simple to remember!):

    - value -> uniq, value -> inout, value -> out

    - uniq -> ref, uniq -> weak

    - ref -> weak

    - inout -> out

- In total, the system is memory-safe without the drawbacks of garbage collection or conventional ref-counted smart-pointers!

### Convenient and safe init / deinit via named constructors / destructors

- Unlike C++, you can specify multiple versions of constructors / destructors

    - Default constructor / destructor: is automatically run, use RAII semantics

    - Custom constructor / destructor: called manually

    - If default constructor / destructor is not specified, usage of value before constructor / after destructor is caught at compile-time!

    - Compiler does branch analysis to ensure that destructor is called at all times during the current scope

- Values are always initialized to zero by default

### Superb C/C++ embedding API, fast interop with C / C++ structs

- An easy-to-use C++ API for binding external code using templates

- Also has a (less ergonomic) C API for people wanting to bind the interpreter with other languages

- Most importantly: C/C++ structs do not have to be boxed, and can be exposed to the language directly!

- Instead there are some limits imposed on the C/C++ struct:

    - Fields need to be 8-byte aligned

    - For safety, use the types provided by the C API (Integer, Double, etc...)

    - For C++, the struct needs to be POD (since the system uses the C ABI)

### IDE support baked in the compiler

- The compiler is built from day-1 for LSP server support (like how Roslyn was made)

- Parses the source code from scratch each keystroke, but with a smart caching system that reuses AST fragments

- Aiming for fast incremental compilation times with this approach to compiler design

### Fast compilation times

- For the bytecode interpreter, will sacrifice some runtime performance to gain compile times / startup times
    - Aiming for faster performance than reference Lua but slower than Java / C#
    - In most cases, binding layer performance should be much more important than raw performance

- In the future, there might be a "transpile to C" option for people who really need the "close-to-metal" performance
    - JITs are nice but they are too complex...
